Nicole's Developer Portfolio

✨ A clean, responsive portfolio showcasing my frontend skills

This portfolio represents my journey in mastering HTML5 and CSS3, demonstrating my ability to:

Write semantic, well-structured HTML with proper sectioning
Implement modern CSS layouts using Flexbox and Grid
Create fully responsive designs that work across all devices
Maintain clean, commented code for easy collaboration

I've paid special attention to:

✔️ Mobile-first responsiveness (check the media queries!)
✔️ Accessibility best practices (semantic tags, color contrast)
✔️ Performance optimization (efficient CSS, proper image handling)
✔️ Maintainable code structure (logical organization, clear comments)

  border-left: 3px solid rgba(255, 182, 193, 0.5); /* Visual accent */
}
